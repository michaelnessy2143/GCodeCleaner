# GCodeCleaner
This code takes all the unnecessary data out of the g-code leaving only the X,Y,Z,E values.  This is for the purpose of taking the output from a slicer like Cura or PrusaSlicer and passing the output to a 6-axis 3D printer.


Description:
This script removes comments from a G-code file and extracts the X, Y, Z, and E values from each line. It produces a cleaned output file with the extracted values.

Usage:
1. Run the script and provide the path to the input G-code file.
2. Enter the path to save the cleaned output file.
â€ƒMake sure that the paths provided are not surronded by "quotes"
3. The script will remove comments and extract X, Y, Z, and E values from the input file.
4. The cleaned output file will be saved in the specified path.

Functions:
1. remove_comments(gcode_file, output_file):
    - Removes comments from the input G-code file and extracts X, Y, Z, and E values.
    - Parameters:
        - gcode_file (str): Path to the input G-code file.
        - output_file (str): Path to save the cleaned output file.
    - Returns: None

Example Usage:
1. Input:
    Enter the path to the input G-code file: /path/to/input.gcode
    Enter the path to save the cleaned output: /path/to/output.txt
   Output:
    X, Y, Z, E values extracted from '/path/to/input.gcode'. Cleaned output saved to '/path/to/output.txt'.

Note:
- The script assumes that the G-code file is in a readable format.
- The output file will contain extracted X, Y, Z, and E values in the same format as the input file, with each line representing a set of values.
- The script uses regular expressions to remove comments and extract the desired values.
- Make sure to have the necessary permissions to read the input file and write to the output file.
